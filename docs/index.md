## Hackserver

It's a workshop platform full of programming challenges!

Worshop development loop is simple:
- read the challenge details
- develop a solution, serve it as http api
- run test suite pointing at your server
- share your solution, get points
- repeat

## Challenges

We make simple stuff difficult! From string manipulation or image format direction through graph theory!
There's a challenge for every level of programming skills. Solution language is up to you!
Points don't matter - but a little bit of rivalry is always fun!
In the end - we want to show you quirks in common protocols/apis, discuss what was more cumbersome in which language and discuss technology solutions.

## Requirements

- local LAN/WLAN connection with workshop host
- ability to host a HTTP server in any framework/language you like
- 4-6 hours of time
